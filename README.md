# 🥔 Potato Disease Classification

A deep learning-based system that classifies potato leaf diseases using image data.  
This project demonstrates the complete end-to-end machine learning workflow — from model training to API deployment and cross-platform integration.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The system detects and classifies potato leaf diseases (e.g., Early Blight, Late Blight, Healthy) using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).  
It provides both **web** and **mobile** interfaces powered by a **FastAPI** backend and **Dockerized** deployment on Google Cloud.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🖼️ Image preprocessing, augmentation, and normalization for model robustness  
- 🧩 Deep learning model built with **TensorFlow/Keras**  
- ⚙️ RESTful APIs deployed using **FastAPI**  
- 🐳 Dockerized architecture for reproducible builds  
- ☁️ Deployed on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**  
- 💻 Frontend built using **React.js** (web) and **React Native** (mobile)  
- 🔄 Continuous integration with **Node.js**, **Yarn**, and **NPM**
